ProteinProductionSim
====================

ProteinProductionSim is a Python-based simulation package that is intended to simulate the production chain from
one DNA strand to mRNAs through RNA polymerases and from mRNAs to proteins through ribosomes. The central focus
of this module is to implement supercooling of DNA strand and confirm its prediction with our experimental data.
